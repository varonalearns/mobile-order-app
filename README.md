# Scrimba - The Frontend Developer Career Path - Module 4 - CSS Fundamentals: Challenges - Solo Project - Oldagram

This is my solution to the [JS Mini Projects - Solo Project - Restaurant Ordering App](https://scrimba.com/playlist/p5gq6B3cr) project, from Scrimba's [The Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend).

## Overview

### The challenge

Requirements:

- Follow the design spect
- Render the menu options using JavaScript
- Be able to add/remove items
- Have a payment modal with compulsory form inputs

Stretch Goals:

- Change the theme
- Offer a "meal deal" discount
- Allow users to rate their experience

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned
I learned a lot working on this project. A LOT. Figuring out how to call functions and in what order to get the results that I want was a long and arduous process. Once I took a step back though, and really thought about what I wanted to accomplish, I managed to get the results that I have now. Even though I know there is probably some mistakes getting to the results that I have, just trying to figure out how to implement this project was a lot of fun.

### Continued development
I hope to come back to this project and implement some of the stretch goals. Maybe even make a full blown app to add to my portfolio. There is definitely more that I need to learn and hope that with more experience I can make this project better.
